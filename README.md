# Open Book Image Format (OBI)

The Open Book Image (OBI) format was created as part of the [Open Book Format](https://github.com/SpaceDandy-Tama/OpenBookFormat) project, designed to be the ultimate ebook format for passionate readers.

The inspiration for developing OBI came from [The Open Book](https://github.com/joeycastillo/The-Open-Book) project. Consequently, the initial version of OBI supports only grayscale images and 4-bit dithering, optimized for the 300x400 e-ink display of *The Open Book*, which is limited to 4-bit color depth.

### Supported Pixel Formats

- **8-bit grayscale**
- **4-bit grayscale**
- **2-bit grayscale**
- **1-bit monochromatic**

### Supported Compression Codecs

- **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**

### Available Dithering Techniques

- **Floyd-Steinberg**
- **Stucki**
- **Blue Noise**

*Note: Full support for .obi files is included in [ImageViewer](https://github.com/SpaceDandy-Tama/ImageViewer) starting from version 2.4.*
